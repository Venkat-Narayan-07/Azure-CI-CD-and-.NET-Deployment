# .NET Calculator App: A Demonstration of Azure CI/CD and .NET Deployment

**Project Overview**
This repository serves as a showcase of my skills in utilizing Azure CI/CD pipelines to deploy a .NET application. I've chosen a simple calculator application to demonstrate the end-to-end process, from development to production deployment.

**Key Technologies**
* Azure DevOps: Used for CI/CD pipeline creation and management.
* GitHub: Repository hosting and source control.
* .NET Framework: The application is built using the .NET framework.
* Azure Web App: Deployed to an Azure Web App resource for hosting.

**Deployment Process**
* Development: The application was developed using [mention your development environment, e.g., Visual Studio].
* Version Control: The code was committed to a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.
* CI/CD Pipeline: An Azure DevOps pipeline was configured to:
  - Build the application.
  - Run unit tests.
  - Deploy to a QA environment.
  - Deploy to a production environment (upon manual approval).

**Key Achievements**
* Successful Deployment: The application was successfully deployed to both QA and production environments.
* Automated Testing: Unit tests were implemented to ensure code quality.
* CI/CD Integration: Demonstrates proficiency in using Azure DevOps for CI/CD.
* Azure Web App Deployment: Experience in deploying applications to the cloud using Azure.

# Additional Notes
By showcasing this project, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in deploying and managing applications on the Azure cloud platform.
